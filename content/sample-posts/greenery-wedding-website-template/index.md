When it comes to designing your wedding, the choice really is yours.
There are a variety of different themes and styles that you can choose from, and it is important to ensure that it is perfect for you.

One theme that we have seen recently and think works beautifully is that of a touch of greenery.
Greenery wedding themes are an alternative to a standard floral theme. Instead of using brightly colored blooms for decoration, a greenery theme will arrange branches, leaves and palms to have a minimalistic but still beautiful effect.
We think that greenery works beautifully for weddings no matter the season, however, you can change the materials you use to match in with when you are getting married.
Want to try it for yourself? Here are some of the best greenery wedding decoration ideas that we have seen recently.

## A greenery wedding cake

A great way that we have seen to incorporate greenery into your wedding is with the cake. Often the focal point of the wedding reception (or at least the part that plenty of guests look forward to) the wedding cake is a great way to embrace your theme. Why not request that is iced with a simple white or cream buttercream, then delicately decorated with leaves or branches. You could even go one step further and have it displayed on a wooden board.

## A leafy table runner

When you think of table runners for your wedding day you are likely to think of lavish gold shades and silky textures. However, it doesn’t always have to be that way. In fact, you can use your green theme in your table runner with ease. Creating a leafy green runner and place golden, silver or perhaps even glittery tea light holders throughout the branches and you will have a table runner that you will be proud to display.

## The bouquet and button holes

Who says that your wedding bouquet and button holes need to be packed full of flowers. Whilst it may be the norm to opt for big and bold blooms, if you are heading for a greenery theme then you may want to opt for more leaves instead. This can be combined with the same style for the button holes, making for a beautiful look that will fit perfectly with your set style.

## Ivy for your archway

Quite a few couples like the idea of saying their vows in an archway, so why not make a plain cream one that little bit more special by adding in some ivy. This will not only offer a beautiful touch of green, but also create a dramatic look that will be perfect for those “I do” pictures.
