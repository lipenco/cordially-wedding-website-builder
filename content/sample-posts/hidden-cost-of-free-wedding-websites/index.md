Did you ever wondered why you might want to pay for your wedding website if there are free options available?

## Free wedding websites not creative

Did you notice that many of your friends who are getting married are sending all the same layouts all over again? Changing a background photo or font is not really that creative and is not likely to impress your guests. Dare to be different, it is your time to shine.

## Free wedding websites are not personal for the guests


Cordially Wedding Website makes it really obvious the main attention is put on your guests. The moment they land on the page you want to impress them with a personalized and custom greeting and RSVP form ready for them to complete. Free website providers don’t care who is currently viewing your site.

## They’re a pain for your guests

Free services don’t allow you to create a custom subdomain. “popular-wedding-platform.com/something/something” is usually a lot harder for your guests to remember than something shorter and 100% unique. Also email with the invitation coming from a website they don't know cannot be compared with the personal message from your own email address. Cordially makes it so easy.

## You are becoming a target

Companies offering free sites have several paid services that they’re using the sites to promote and upsell. Whats more they can use your email as their marketing medium. Your email address is highly valued because many companies might want to pay to send the email promoting their bridal dresses or honeymoon and target you. At worst, they might even show ads on your website. Cordially never uses your nor your guest's emails for marketing purposes.


## You cannot count on custom changes

The goal of those big wedding platforms is to serve as many couples as possible, at the expense of personalization and individual attention. If you need something special for your site, our customer service team can make those custom changes for you. One-size-fits-all wedding platforms aren’t interested in providing custom corrections for you. Cordially team will be happy to help you.

We’re obviously a bit biased :) but these pains are a big reason why we created Cordially in the first place.
