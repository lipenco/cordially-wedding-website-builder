RSVP tracking is a difficult problem. It takes a lot of experience and technical background to be able to solve it properly. At Cordially we have spent hours researching how our users interact with our RSVP tracking tool to make it the best on the market. We know that NO information from the invited guest is the WORST information. Our research team has identified the main characteristic for our online wedding invitations that can satisfy the needs of the most demanding couples.

## Electronic invitation should be creative

The impression starts with your Save the Date website.
It will be the first time your guests will get to know your wedding esthetics and overall wedding day vibe. Do you want to use the same wedding templates like your 3 other friends? Why not, but perhaps you can do better than this. At Cordially we spent a lot of time to polish up our templates, making them creative and up to date. We are obviously biased, but we think it is the most creative option out there that cost (way) less than $1k.


## Online invitations should be sent from your personal email

Cordially is not spamming your guests with a bot like an email address. Our technical solution set your personal email address as a sender. It makes the invitations more intimate and easy to deliver and respond. Nobody likes to open emails from unknown sources.


## Your online RSVPs should be about your guest

At least this is what we believe in. If your goal is to make your guest feel special you need to personalize your invitation to include your guest name or even a tender phrase like: "dearest friend Anna".Using Cordially you have it out of the box.

We know that NO information from the invited guest is the WORST information. This is why we build Cordially to avoid this situation. We will let you know if your email was not delivered. A quick glimpse through your guest list will make it clear for you who opened the email, who clicked on the invitation link and who's email was not delivered because the email address was simply not correct. To our knowledge, none of our competitors are tracking the invitation emails for you.
