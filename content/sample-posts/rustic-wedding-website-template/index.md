Everyone has their very own idea of how their wedding day will be. Some will want a luxurious, opulent and glamorous affair. Some will want to opt for a particular theme. Some will love the idea of heading for a more rustic wedding.

No matter which you are thinking, the thing to remember is that having a wedding of a particular style is all about the details.

We love the idea of a rustic wedding here at Cordially, which is why we have set up our guide to achieving the perfect rustic wedding.

## In the "middle of nowhere" is so intimate

One of the biggest things to consider when you want a rustic wedding is where it will be. The ideal setting for rustic wedding has to be somewhere rural. So think about barns, countryside locations and those venues that are definitely more “middle of nowhere” rather than city centre. It is a theme for nature lovers.

## See the beauty of craft

When organizing a rustic wedding, you will notice that plenty of those smaller touches come in the form of things that may not be 100% perfect but 100% yours. Some brides may not like the idea of this. But if you want to fully embrace rustic style, then you are going to need to see the beauty in the imperfect. Think shabby chic, think boho, think entirely and utterly unique!

## Rustic with modern touches

Just because you like the idea of a rustic wedding, that doesn’t mean that you have to totally throw away all the modern bits that you see in other weddings. Fancy a photobooth? Go for it! Maybe just match the props into the rest of your wedding style. The thing to remember is that while you are heading for a particular theme, that it doesn’t mean that you can’t add in a few extras!

## Who doesn’t love a rustic cake?

A simple way to really add a touch of rustic charm to your wedding is with your wedding cake. Gone are the days when you have to have a large, ornate, and iced cake with hundreds of tiers. Now, we are seeing more and more couples who decide to go for something a whole lot more understated. In fact, there has been a rise in the rustic or naked cake. Completely un-iced and usually decorated in fruit, these cakes are a great centerpiece for any wedding reception.
