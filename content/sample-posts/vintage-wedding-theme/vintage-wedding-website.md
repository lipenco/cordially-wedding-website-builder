But how can you make sure that you have a perfectly modern vintage wedding? Here are some of our ideas that you can try out for yourself.

## Make old new again

One of the most common things that you will see with modern vintage weddings is that things that could be considered as old are refreshed, renewed and look beautiful again. There are a variety of ways that you can do this is to buy a second hand, vintage wedding dress and ask for a talented dressmaker to transform it into something new.

You can also take a look through the local charity shops and buy some of the essential accessories for your reception. This is particularly a good idea if you are having mismatching, vintage styled crockery for an afternoon tea set-up.
