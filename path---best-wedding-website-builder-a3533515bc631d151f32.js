From your gift registry to your guests’ RSVPs and the location details—the convenience of having a wedding website for you and your attendees cannot be understated.</p>\n<p>But how do you build a truly personal online invitation without years of programming experience, compromising on your design tastes, or your guests feeling unimpressed by a mass-produced invitation?</p>\n<h2>Your guests play an important role in your website design</h2>\n<p>Your online wedding invitation needs to feel as special for your guests and look as gorgeous as if they had received a beautifully calligraphed paper invitation in the post.</p>\n<p>If your guests receive a link that serves everybody, with no mention of their individual name, then your efforts were in vain. At Cordially, we believe that the best impression starts with your guests feeling special. We have created a tool that helps you personalize your guest experience efficiently by enabling you to specify personalised wording and a unique URL while adding each new guest to your list.</p>\n<p><img src="http://cordially.co/static/img/rustic-wedding-website.jpg" alt="rustic wedding website builder"></p>\n<p>Imagine your name is Sara and your fiancé is Michael, and one of your invited couples is Isabella and William. In this case, their invitation URL may be  s-m.cordially.co/for-isabella-and-william or if you want to add your own domain, it could be your-domain.com/for-isabella-and-william.</p>\n<p>However, a unique URL is just the beginning. Now it’s time for the wording—a special phrase that you use exclusively for Isabella and William. It can be a something sweet like “our dearest friends Isabella and William” or the more classic: “Isabella and William Anderson”. What you choose depends on your relationship with the person or can be a style that matches your wedding vibe.</p>\n<p>The personalization can go even further. How about uploading your guests’ avatars, which they can see on their RSVP form? It’s all about making your guests feel even more engaged and welcomed.</p>\n<h2>Wedding website that match your wedding style</h2>\n<p>Your wedding website should be a reflection of your wedding style. So give yourself ample time to get it just right. Cordially aims to make your choice as wide as possible. If you change your mind or style, then you can always switch your template. Whether you’re planning a rustic barn wedding or something more vintage, Cordially are here to serve you.</p>\n<p>RSVP forms and buttons add another layer of personalization. Be official or fun … when creating RSVP wording, you can really invoke the mood you are aiming for.</p>\n<h2>Wedding website is all about your relationship and the big day event</h2>\n<p>You don’t really need to write a saga about your first date. The internet is better for short forms. “It all started at a NYE party” is substantial enough. Your wedding website is a place to show off your elegant engagement photos, or less classy but fun selfies.\nThe information function needs to be well-executed too. Add location pins to the map, make sure everybody knows what time they need to show up, and kindly ask for an RSVP. Start small. Before you research the best accommodation options, you might want to create a simple “Save the Date” page and add more content sections when you are ready. The Cordially website creator makes it easy to switch your website content sections on and off.</p>\n<p><img src="http://cordially.co/static/img/wedding-website-creator.png" alt="wedding website creator"></p>\n<p>There are many wedding website creators out there, but they all seem to forget the important role of guest personalization. Not to mention their mass-produced designs. Here comes Cordially—fresh and brand new. We’d be happy to hear your feedback and product suggestions.
