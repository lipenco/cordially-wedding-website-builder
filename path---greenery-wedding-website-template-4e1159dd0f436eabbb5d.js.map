Often the focal point of the wedding reception (or at least the part that plenty of guests look forward to) the wedding cake is a great way to embrace your theme. Why not request that is iced with a simple white or cream buttercream, then delicately decorated with leaves or branches.

However, it doesn’t always have to be that way. In fact, you can use your green theme in your table runner with ease. Creating a leafy green runner and place golden, silver or perhaps even glittery tea light holders throughout the branches and you will have a table runner that you will be proud to display.\\n<img src=\\\"http://cordially.co/static/img/Greenery-table-runner.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"greenery wedding theme - button holes\\\"></p>\\n<h2>The bouquet and button holes</h2>\\n<p>Who says that your wedding bouquet and button holes need to be packed full of flowers. Whilst it may be the norm to opt for big and bold blooms, if you are heading for a greenery theme then you may want to opt for more leaves instead. This can be combined with the same style for the button holes, making for a beautiful look that will fit perfectly with your set style.\\n<img src=\\\"http://cordially.co/static/img/greenery-wedding-boutonnieres.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"greenery wedding theme - button holes\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Ivy for your archway</h2>\\n<p>Quite a few couples like the idea of saying their vows in an archway, so why not make a plain cream one that little bit more special by adding in some ivy.
