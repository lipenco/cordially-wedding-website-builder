Also email with the invitation coming from a website they don\'t know cannot be compared with the personal message from your own email address.

Whats more they can use your email as their marketing medium. Your email address is highly valued because many companies might want to pay to send the email promoting their bridal dresses or honeymoon and target you. At worst, they might even show ads on your website. Cordially never uses your nor your guest\'s emails for marketing purposes.</p>\n<h2 id="you-cannot-count-on-custom-changes"><a href="#you-cannot-count-on-custom-changes" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>You cannot count on custom changes</h2>\n<p>The goal of those big wedding platforms is to serve as many couples as possible, at the expense of personalization and individual attention.
