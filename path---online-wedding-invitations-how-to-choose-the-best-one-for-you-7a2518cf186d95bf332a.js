Do you want to use the same wedding templates like your other three friends used before? Why not? But perhaps you can do better than this. At Cordially we spent a lot of time to polish up our templates, making them creative and up to date. We are obviously biased, but we think it is the most creative option out there that cost (way) less than $1k.</p>\n<h2 id="online-invitations-should-be-sent-from-your-personal-email"><a href="#online-invitations-should-be-sent-from-your-personal-email" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Online invitations should be sent from your personal email</h2>\n<p>Cordially is not spamming your guests with an no-response email delivery bot.
