The ideal setting for rustic wedding has to be somewhere rural. So think about barns, countryside locations and those venues that are definitely more “middle of nowhere” rather than city centre. It is a theme for nature lovers.</p>\n<p><img src="http://cordially.co/static/img/rustic-wedding-theme-location.jpg" alt="rustic wedding locations">\n<img src="http://cordially.co/static/img/rustic-wedding-website-theme-location.jpg" alt="rustic wedding website locations"></p>\n<h2 id="see-the-beauty-of-craft"><a href="#see-the-beauty-of-craft" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>See the beauty of craft</h2>\n<p>When organizing a rustic wedding, you will notice that plenty of those smaller touches come in the form of things that may not be 100% perfect but 100% yours. Some brides may not like the idea of this. But if you want to fully embrace rustic style, then you are going to need to see the beauty in the imperfect.

Gone are the days when you have to have a large, ornate, and iced cake with hundreds of tiers. Now, we are seeing more and more couples who decide to go for something a whole lot more understated. In fact, there has been a rise in the rustic or naked cake. Completely un-iced and usually decorated in fruit, these cakes are a great centerpiece for any wedding reception.</p>\n<p><img src="http://cordially.co/static/img/rustic-naked-cake.jpg" alt="rustic wedding theme - naked cake"></p>\n<h2 id="dont-forget-our-template-for-your-rustic-wedding-website"><a href="#dont-forget-our-template-for-your-rustic-wedding-website" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Don’t forget our template for your rustic wedding website</h2>\n<p>When it comes to organising a rustic wedding, you can’t go far wrong by setting up your own wedding website.
